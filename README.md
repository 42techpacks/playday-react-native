# Overview
Just going to brain dump for now, we can make this more formal later.

We will be using sapling to speed up the code contribution process.

I recommend reading the [sapling getting started guide](https://sapling-scm.com/docs/introduction/getting-started)
But the main things you need to remember are:
1. To initially get the branch on your computer use `sl clone <link>` where link
is the https: link of the repo (‚ö†Ô∏è note: HTTPS not SSH)
2. run `sl web` from the directory of the repo to launch the pretty intuitive sapling web ui
3. be sure to add the tag associated with your linear task to the commit message it will start with S28
4. Do not overcommit. Amend work related to a single task to existing commit

# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
3. Start Convex

   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project
‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: Kenny already did this

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
