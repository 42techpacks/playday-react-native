# Overview
Just going to brain dump for now, we can make this more formal later.

We will be using a combination of linear and sapling to speed up the code contribution
and task delegation prcoess.

I recommend reading the [sapling getting started guide](https://sapling-scm.com/docs/introduction/getting-started)
But the main thing you need to remember are 
1. To initially get the branch on your computer use `sl clone <link>` where link
is the https: link of the repo (note HTTPS not SSH)
2. run `sl web` from the directory of the repo to launch the pretty intuitive sapling web ui
3. be sure to add the tag associated with your linear task to the commit message it will start with S28
4. Do no overcommit. amend work related to a single task to existing commit
